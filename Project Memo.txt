I used BeautifulSoup, a Python Librabry tp scrap data on the Top 250 movies.

I parse the HTMl file and extractred the text in the website's front-end code. I then appended the scrapped data
-Movie title
-Movie date
-Movie rating
-Movie Rank

using data and saved them into an excel file for futher editing.

I formatted hte borders of the excel cells to fit in data
I used Find & Replace to remove () in the Date column.

I then saved as an CSV file and imported as a table on MySQL Workbench
Extracted top movies 1-10 in the year 2000 below and 2000 above and sorted by their ratings
So we can which century has the most rated movies

and i then plotted a bar chart to show the diffrence

i then used a graded excel file to show how much % of both the to pmovies and tv series fall undet a specific grde

I then imported the excel file as queries in a model in PoeerBi
